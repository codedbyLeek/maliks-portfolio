### About Me

My name is **Malik Scruggs**, and I am a detail-oriented and solutions-focused developer with practical experience in **front-end development, backend architecture, and digital asset implementation**. I thrive in environments where clean structure, organized workflow, and efficient system design are essential.

I have worked with **Salesforce Apex development**, **full-stack web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**, and **API-driven backend logic**. In addition, I have experience in **UI customization**, **3D digital asset workflows**, and **visual design integration**, particularly in modded and customized environments.

I prioritize writing code and documentation that is clear, maintainable, and scalable. I approach technical problems by understanding the underlying system, evaluating the requirements, and building solutions with purpose rather than unnecessary complexity.

I am currently developing deeper mastery in the following areas:

* **C Programming Fundamentals** (memory management, pointers, data structures)
* **Salesforce Platform & Apex Logic / Automation**
* **API-based system integration and backend data modeling**
* **Structured UI layout systems and component-based design**

My professional values include reliability, attention to detail, persistence, and thoughtful execution. I am actively working to build a portfolio that reflects both technical depth and professional craftsmanship.

I am open to:

* **Software Engineering Internships / Entry-Level Roles**
* **Technical collaboration and learning partnerships**
* **Projects focused on problem-solving and long-term maintainability**
